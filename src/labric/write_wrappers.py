"""Helpers for writing records to Labric tables, mixed into the exported client (see client.py).

`client.write_core_table` and `client.write_labric_table` send data to the write endpoint in a
single request by default. Set rows_per_batch to split a large data list across multiple requests
instead, e.g.:

    client.write_labric_table(
        "measurements", data=rows, rows_per_batch=1000,
        on_progress=lambda written, total: logger.info(f"{written}/{total} written"),
    )

Each batch is also capped at MAX_BATCH_BYTES of serialized JSON, so wide rows can't
push a single request over the API's body size limit even when rows_per_batch would
otherwise allow it.

Each batch is its own request and therefore its own transaction: if a batched write
fails partway through, the earlier batches remain committed and the rest are not
retried, since replaying a batch that already landed would duplicate rows in
mode="create". Pass on_progress to track how many rows were written before a
failure.

Pass job_execution_id (or set the LABRIC_JOB_EXECUTION_ID environment variable) to
record every batch against a single job execution, so the whole write can be
reverted or inspected as one unit. Without it, each batch gets its own job
execution.

Pass collect_output=False unless you need the written rows back -- otherwise every
row is echoed back by the API and accumulated in memory.

# A reasonable rows_per_batch for append-only writes (mode="create"). Upserts need

# the API's 2.5 MB body limit so the surrounding request fields still fit.
# rows_per_batch alone can't guarantee this -- wide rows exceed the limit long before
# the row count does -- so batches are also cut on size. Measuring it costs one JSON
# encode per row on top of the encode the client performs when sending the request,
# which is negligible next to the network round trip each batch makes.
